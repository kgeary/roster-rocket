# Overview
This tool gives homeschool admin teams an easy way to view class rosters, get student or parent info, and see what classes each student is registered for. It will also make collecting and managing dues easy and convenient, and gives parents an easy way to register and pay.

This was a final collaborative project for the UT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.

## Problem

In Texas alone, there are approximately 1000 homeschool co-ops. These organizations are typically run by parents who volunteer their time and efforts to make a positive learning environment for their children. 

Some of the biggest challenges for the admin team center on organizing and managing the classes and rosters. Our project will offer homeschool admin teams an easy way to manage enrollment, manage class rosters, and even track class dues.

### Real World Problems
* There is no easy way for homeschool admin teams to manage students and the classes each child is registered for. 
* Admin teams typically use a spreadsheet application to try to manage this data, but these tables can very quickly become overwhelming and messy.
* Organizing classes, registering students, and tracking payments can be incredibly time-consuming. As parent volunteers, these processes can be overwheming.
* Parents generally lack a transparent method for calculating the amount due, how to register their children for the available classes, and how to pay. 
* Typically, there is a separate treasurer who is responsible for collecting and determining dues each parent owes. 

### User Stories

As an admin, I want an easy way to organize students into available classes, see what students are registered to what classes, and track if a parent has paid their dues. I also want to have a simple way to see a list of students in a class, and track payments for each class.

As a parent, I want an easy way to sign my children up for home school co-op classes, see class info, see what classes my children are in, and I want an easy way to pay for those classes.

## Business

### The Market is Growing

According to <a href="https://www.nheri.org/homeschool-population-size-growing/">research on the growth rates of homeschool trends</a>, the number of homeschooled children is growing at a tremendous rate.  

<img src="images/growthRate.jpg" title="Homeschool Growth Trends" alt="Homeschool Trends" width=600px>

Even with this tremendous growth, still less than 4% of the school age children in the US are homeschooled. Homeschool learning has become a viable, mainstream option for families. 

The growth rate of homeschool co-op groups is trending in the same direction. Parents are creating co-ops to suppliment learning, provide a social outlet for group learning, and to provide support and camraderie.

### Current Tools

There are tools on the market that focus on admin teams to assist with running schools and groups. Unfortunately, the current tools are ill-suited for managing smaller groups like homeschool co-ops. 
* Existing tools are too expensive
* Existing tools are far too heavy and contain unnecessary features.
* The learning curve is too steep. 

### Our Solution

Roster Rocket meets the exact needs of the small homeschool co-op market. The platform can be expanded in the future if additional features are requested. It is easy to use and will alleviate many of the challenges currently faced by these small admin teams.
